						<p><b>E-Cig Pen Type <br><br>
A vape pen is a simple and basic vaporizer that is usually an eGo style battery with a fitted clearomizer such as the CE4 clearomizer. The definition of it is more of a broad term, consisting of a long form battery with a tailored tank similar to an appearance of a pen with a larger diameter. The vape pen can be used with e-juices, wax, and essential oils. The eGo-T CE4, the Kangertech eVod, and the Yocan Exgo W1 are some examples of what is consider as a vape pen.</b></p>

They house an internal and rechargeable battery, plus a self-contained oven that uses conduction heating to vaporize cannabis. Here are the best dry herb vape pens available right now.</b><br><br>

										<p><b>Pax vaporizer by Ploom<br><br>
My local head shop says the Pax Ploom is its top-selling vaporizer, so naturally I wanted to check it out. On first glance, its allure is obvious: The handheld smoking device resembles a bulky iPod player, with a shimmering brushed aluminum case, an indicator light on the front and minimal branding on the back. Not typically swayed by form over function, I found myself immediately attracted to the machine’s sexy Apple-knockoff stylings.</b></p>
